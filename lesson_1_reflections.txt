How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

I can see what changes I made from one file to another and I can look typos.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I could see my progress and I could split my code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

pros: total control, I decide what is a logical step for me
cons: I can forget making the commit, it is possible between commits I do not do so much advance.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

because it is the same project, so it is easier to track like a single project instad of separarted files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

with git log I can see the entire repository. Git diff allows to compare to commits in order to search a differences.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Si la cago no pasa nada

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

take all my codes all put them of git please!
